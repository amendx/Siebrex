# JADE SIEBRA :rainbow:


* Hi, my name is Jade, I'm graduated in law school :flushed:, but I'm trying to find my away on the incredible world of programming :sparkles:. 

* I consider myself a very calm and loving person, a huge fan of sports, passionate about biking, in love with animals and learning new things :grin:.


* So I'm basic an :alien: in this world. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java **on my own**.
